Tulu (formerly known as June AI) is an AI-based store assistant that can answer customer questions and turn them into sales. The project is not being actively maintained and was last updated in 2023. Therefore, the technologies used in this project may not be state-of-the-art. 

To use Tulu, store owners can either integrate their existing Shopify store or create one manually. If the Shopify route was taken, Tulu will automatically fetch all of the store's available products, along with their information, and build an agent that can give customers product recommendations. For manually created stores, store owners can also manually add their products in.

Tulu will then generate a unique link that store owners can give their customers for them to ask questions about the store and get product recommendations based on their needs.

Attached below is the recorded demo:
